This was the project that got me off the ground with using react and gatsby. I had done the gatsby tutorial during the government shutdown in January of 2019. I had been trying to teach myself to use vim as an editor and spent the time to punch out all of the pages into a single file and then used python to split the pages into markdown files. These can be used to create content with gatsby's "gatsby-transformer-remark" plugin. I added the slider for navigation, but the book can be read pretty quickly.
