This was my project using react and gatsby. During the government shutdown in January of 2019, I had been trying to teach myself to use vim as an editor and spent the time to punch out all of the pages into a single file first and then used python to split the pages into markdown files. These can be used to create content with gatsby's "gatsby-transformer-remark" plugin. I added the slider for navigation, but the book can be read pretty quickly. Here's a clip of the string parsing that I used in python to accomplish the task...

```python
import sys
sys.prefix
```
